# Quicksort Algorithm

Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two groups: those less than the pivot and those greater than the pivot.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(n _ log(n))
Average: O(n _ log(n))
Worst: O(n^2)

## Space Complexity

O(log(n))

## Example Use Case

Sorting a large dataset when the worst-case performance is unlikely to be encountered, such as when the input data is randomly ordered or the pivot selection strategy is optimized.
