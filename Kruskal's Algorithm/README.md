# Kruskal's Algorithm

Kruskal's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree for a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges. It works by repeatedly selecting the edge with the lowest weight that does not form a cycle.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(E _ log(E))
Average: O(E _ log(E))
Worst: O(E \* log(E))

## Space Complexity

O(V + E)

## Example Use Case

Finding the minimum spanning tree in a connected graph, such as designing a network with minimal wiring cost or determining the optimal route for connecting a set of cities with roads.
