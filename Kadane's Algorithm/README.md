# Kadane's Algorithm

Kadane's Algorithm is an efficient method for finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array that has the largest sum.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(n)
Average: O(n)
Worst: O(n)

## Space Complexity

O(1)

## Example Use Case

Finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, such as analyzing the largest profit that can be made from a series of stock prices or determining the longest period of sustained growth in a time series.
