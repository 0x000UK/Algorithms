# Binary Search Algorithm

Binary search is an efficient search algorithm that works on a sorted array or list. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half, narrowing down the possible locations of the target value until it is found or the interval is empty.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(1)
Average: O(log n)
Worst: O(log n)

## Space Complexity

O(1) for iterative implementation
O(log n) for recursive implementation

## Example Use Case

Searching for a specific value in a large, sorted dataset, such as looking up a word in a dictionary or finding a customer record in a database.
