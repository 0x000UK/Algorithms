# Flood Fill Algorithm

The Flood Fill algorithm is used to determine the area connected to a given node in a two-dimensional array or matrix. It can be implemented using either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) and is often used in image processing or maze-solving applications.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(n)
Average: O(n)
Worst: O(n)

## Space Complexity

O(n)

## Example Use Case

Filling a region with a specific color in a paint application or identifying connected components in an image for object recognition.
