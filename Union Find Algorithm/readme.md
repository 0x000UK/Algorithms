UNION FIND ALGORITHM

The efficiency of a Data Structure depends on how efficiently it handles the query of some problem statement. 
A good choice of data structure can reduce the execution time and that is what comes in handy in real-life problems. 
Disjoint Set Union (DSU) is one such data structure. It is also referred to as Union Find because of the functionalities it provides.
The union-find algorithm is a data structure that maintains a collection of disjoint sets. It provides two primary operations: union, which merges two sets into one, and find, 
which determines which set a particular element belongs to. 
This data structure is used in graph algorithms, to efficiently handle connectivity and partitioning problems.

Complexity Analysis->   
Time Complexity: O(log N), where n is the number of nodes.   
Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes.
