# Merge Sort Algorithm

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by recursively dividing the input array into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the two sorted halves back together.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(n _ log(n))
Average: O(n _ log(n))
Worst: O(n \* log(n))

## Space Complexity

O(n)

## Example Use Case

Sorting a large dataset when a stable sort is required, such as sorting a list of customers by last name and then by first name, or sorting a list of transactions by date and then by amount.
