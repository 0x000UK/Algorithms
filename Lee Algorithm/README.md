# Lee Algorithm

The Lee Algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest path between two points in a grid, considering obstacles. It uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore the grid, and it can handle diagonal moves as well.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(n^2)
Average: O(n^2)
Worst: O(n^2)

## Space Complexity

O(n^2)

## Example Use Case

Finding the shortest path between two points in a grid with obstacles, such as routing a wire on a circuit board or navigating a robot through a maze.
